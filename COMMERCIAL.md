# Commercial License

## Dual Licensing Model

This project is available under a dual licensing model:

1. **Open Source License**: GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)
2. **Commercial License**: Proprietary license for commercial use

## Why Commercial License?

The AGPL-3.0 is a strong copyleft license that requires any derivative works to also be released under AGPL-3.0. This means:

- ✅ Perfect for open source projects
- ✅ Great for academic research  
- ✅ Ideal for contributing back to the community
- ❌ Cannot be used in proprietary/closed-source applications
- ❌ Requires sharing your source code if you distribute
- ❌ Requires sharing source code even for network/web services (SaaS)

## Commercial License Benefits

### ✅ **Freedom to Use**
